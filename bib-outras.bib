  abstract	= { This paper defends the view that the intricate
		  difficulties challenging the emerging domain of Musical
		  Pattern Discovery, which is dedicated to the automation of
		  motivic analysis, will be overcome only through a thorough
		  taking into account of the specificity of music as a
		  perceptive object. Actual musical patterns, although
		  constantly transformed, are nevertheless perceived by the
		  listener as musical identities. Such dynamical properties
		  of human perception, not reducible to geometrical models,
		  will only be explained with the notions of contexts and
		  expectations. This paper sketches the general principles of
		  a new approach that attempts to build such a general
		  perceptual system. On a sub-cognitive level, patterns are
		  discovered through the detection, by an associative memory,
		  of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are
		  managed by a general logical framework that avoids
		  irrelevant inferences and combinatorial explosion. In this
		  way, actual musical patterns that convey musical
		  significance are discovered. This approach, offering
		  promising results, is a first step toward a complete system
		  of automated music analysis and an explicit modeling of
		  basic mechanisms for music understanding.},

		  periodicities from audio recordings in order to find the
		  metrical hierarchy and timing patterns by which the style
		  of the music can be recognised: the first method performs
		  onset detection and clustering of inter-onset intervals,
		  the second uses autocorrelation on the amplitude envelopes
		  of band-limited versions of the signal as its method of
		  periodicity detection. The relationships between
		  periodicities are then used to find the metrical hierarchy
		  and to estimate the tempo at the beat and measure levels of
		  the hierarchy. The periodicities are then interpreted as
		  musical note values, and the estimated tempo, meter and the
		  distribution of periodicities are used to predict the style
		  of music using a simple set of rules. The methods are
		  evaluated with a test set of standard and Latin dance
		  music, for which the style and tempo are given on the CD
		  cover, providing a ground truth by which the automatic
		  classification can be measured.},

		  rhythm, artist, style or other aspects of music. For each
		  view the pieces of music are organized on a map in such a

		  The maps are visualized using an Islands of Music metaphor
		  where islands represent groups of similar pieces. The maps
		  are linked to each other using a new technique to align
		  self-organizing maps. The user is able to browse the
		  collection and explore different aspects by gradually
		  changing focus from one view to another. We demonstrate our
		  approach on a small collection using a
